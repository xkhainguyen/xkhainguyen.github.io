This set of projects was within the Global Project-Based Learning Program (online), hosted by Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan. Some key points:

- Collaborated with international teams and advised by Professor Goro Fujita.
- Trained practical techniques in the design and development of control systems and basic knowledge in control theory in stages from basics to simple applications while actually running experiments.
- Projects including Motor Speed Control using DC Motor, Motor Position Control using RC Servo, Ball and Beam System, Synchronous Generator Control (Speed and Voltage).
