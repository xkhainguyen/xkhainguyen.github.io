I was a participant of the [ETH Robotics Summer School 2023](https://robotics-summerschool.ethz.ch/).

This program immersed me in the world of robotics like never before. I dove deep into topics like state estimation, SLAM, path planning, trajectory optimization, and camera modeling. The highlight? Programming (semi-)autonomous rough-terrain UGVs and successfully competing in the search and rescue challenge. A special shoutout to my incredible team – we burned the midnight oil, and the 'Eureka' moments were unforgettable.

Check out our [[slides]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pkJnK43eSVaMsvn1HqtbWfd6pOPdZmcgZHq_mU3nwP8/edit?usp=sharing) for more details about our work.
