This is my previous set of projects at the Advanced Power Electronic System (APES) Lab at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Several papers are listed in [publications](/../publications){:target="_blank"} page. Some key points:
- Led a team to develop wireless power transfer, static and dynamic wireless charging system for electric vehicles.
- Tested prototype wireless charging systems (66-80% efficiency); compared it with simulation (90% efficiency).
- Formulated Extended Kalman Filter to dynamically estimate vehicle states and parameters; reduced noises by 50%.
