I am currently involved in exciting projects, including AI-powered humanoid robots, sampling-based optimal control, and implicit deep learning. I'm thrilled to continue advancing robotics and AI as I begin my PhD at MIT EECS in Fall 2025.

I did my MS with [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/) at the Robotics Institute, CMU.  In the summer of 2023, I was a Robotics Student Fellow at the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I did my [BS in Control Engineering and Automation--Talent Program](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/).

<h2>research</h2>

I am driven by elegant solution methods in robot learning and control that target high performance, safety guarantees, data efficiency, and robust generalizationâ€”key milestones toward embodied intelligence.

I am open to exploring various theoretical and practical aspects of robotics, drawing on my background in control theory, differentiable optimization, and machine learning.
