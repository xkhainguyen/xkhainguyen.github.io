I am a first-year PhD student at MIT EECS, working on AI and robotics. 

I earned my MS at CMU with Zac Manchester in the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), and my BS in Control Engineering and Automation at [HUST](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en/). I have also been a Robotics Student Fellow in the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, and worked in R&D at [VinRobotics](https://vinrobotics.net/) and [Viettel Aerospace Institute](https://www.linkedin.com/company/viettelaerospace/posts/?feedView=all).

<h2>research</h2>

I am driven by elegant solution methods that target high performance, safety guarantees, data efficiency, and robust generalization—key milestones toward embodied intelligence.

I explore various theoretical and practical aspects of embodied intelligence, drawing on my background in robotics, controls, differentiable optimization, and machine learning.
